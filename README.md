# A Universal Obstruction to Simulating (x,y,z,x+y+z) in Near-Extremal 3-AP-Free Sets

## Abstract
This repository contains a public preprint resolving the modern formulation of Erdős problem #142 concerning whether the linear form (x,y,z,x+y+z) can be simulated inside near-extremal 3-term-progression-free subsets of the integers.

The work establishes a purely combinatorial digit-structured reduction showing that every such set admits a bounded-variability, carry-controlled representation. Within this reduced model, configurations realizing (x,y,z,x+y+z) are exponentially suppressed in the effective dimension, uniformly over all admissible carry structures.

The argument is unconditional and does not rely on inverse theorems, analytic structure, or assumptions about specific constructions.

## What is proved
- A digit-slice compression mechanism for near-extremal 3-AP-free sets
- A non-circular structural reduction to a carry-controlled model
- Applicability of a finite hypergraph container theorem
- A universal Behrend-type obstruction to simulating (x,y,z,x+y+z)

## What is not claimed
- No explicit bound on r₃(N)
- No classification of all extremal sets
- No reliance on Fourier or analytic methods
